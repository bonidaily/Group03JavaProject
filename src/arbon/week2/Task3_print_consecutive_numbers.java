/*
Write a function:
that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line.
 However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively.
 If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the
 respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should
 be replacÃ©e by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
